Here is the second line with some additional content
We are now on the third line of this text file
Add text to the file content
This is the fifth line, and we're halfway there
Adding more content to make a 10-line document
This is the seventh line in our text file
Only two more lines to go to reach our goal
We're almost done, this is the ninth line
And here is the final, tenth line of the document
